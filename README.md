# SpeechToTextTranslator
This code uses Watson Speech to Text API to convert speech to English text and Watson Language Translator API to convert obtained English text to other Language(Spanish)

In this notebook, I convert an audio file of an English speaker to text using a Speech to Text API. Then, I will translate the English version to a Spanish version using a Language Translator API. Note: API keys and endpoints must be obtained to complete the lab.
